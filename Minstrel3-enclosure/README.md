# Minstrel 3 Enclosure
This is a design for a 3d printed enclosure for Tynemouth Software's
Minstrel 3 with its pushbutton keyboard. The Minstrel 3 is a Sinclair ZX81 clone.

The case allows access to the Minstrel 3's expansion edge connector. Small slider switches can be used to break out the option jumpers on the Minstrel3 PCB - allowing, for example, the grey border or inverse mode to be switched or for different ROM images to be selected..

STLs are provided for the different parts. It's recommended to print with 3 perimeters at 0.2mm layer height. 0.3mm will also work. 3 perimeters allow the side walls to be mostly solid. You can use eith PLA or PETG. 

In addition to the 3d printed parts you will need:

* 4 x M3x12mm countersunk machine screws for attaching the lid to the base
* 6 x 3mm dia by 10mm or 12mm self tapping screws for the keyboard overlay and rear switch holder bar
* Up to 5 miniature slide switches for the option jumpers
* optional 4x JST-XH style 3way 2.54mm pitch housings and connectors for the jumpers - these are lower profile than jumper pins and Dupont connectors - or just solder the switch wires to the jumper pins
* hookup wire and heatshrink sleeving for the switches
* 4 x circular rubber feet 10mm diameter to stop the case from slipping

The case was designed using Fusion 360 - the original design file is
included if you wish to adapt it. It is meant to be reminiscent of the original ZX81 design while being easy to print. A textured print surface gives a nice finish to the top and bottom of the case.

I have also made a case design based on this one to house the Minstrel 3 and ZXpand PCB.
